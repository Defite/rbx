# Customize rbx

Sometimes the default [Bulma](https://bulma.io) styles aren't enough.
That's a feature and not a bug, and the Bulma docs are quick to demonstrate [how to customize the SASS](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/) to your liking.

## Modifying SASS variables

If you're modifying SASS values without introducing anything new, you don't have to keep reading. If you are **adding** or **removing** variables (or **adding** to or **removing** from SASS arrays), the following docs _are_ relevant.

There are many places in **rbx** that leverage these variable overrides: the global modifier helpers (located at `/base/helpers`) as well as components like `<Button>` (and more than 20 others).

## Overview

Before we get on to an example, here's an overview of how we use _TypeScript_ to customize what props are supported.

Take a look at the [source code for the **helpers variables**](https://github.com/dfee/rbx/blob/master/src/base/helpers/variables.ts), or the [source code for `<Button>`](https://github.com/dfee/rbx/blob/master/src/elements/button/button.tsx), and you'll notice two very important expressions:

1. the `DEFAULTS` or `<COMPONENT>_DEFAULTS` variable that defines the defaults in a `const`.
2. a `Variables` or `<Component>Variables` `type` that uses those defaults to construct a _TypeScript_ type.

Looking deeper at the **DEFAULTS**, that's where the _Bulma_ defaults are defined in code.
For example, `colors` on `DEFAULTS` (exported as a property of the `Generic` component), and `sizes` on `BUTTON_DEFAULTS` (exported as `DEFAULTS` prop on the `Button` component).

Looking deeper at the **Variables**, you'll realize that `Variables` is actually just a merge of `VariablesDefaults` and `VariablesOverrides`.

Below we'll talk more about how to override these.

## An example: introducing a new color

To add the color `"react"` (the React logo-color) so that all components can use it (across props like `textColor` and `backgroundColor` as well as with component-specific props like `color` on `<Button>`), you'll need to extend the `$colors` variable before import Bulma's SASS.

Your new SASS file (imported somewhere in your App) will look something like this:

```
# App.sass

@charset 'utf-8';

@import "~bulma/sass/utilities/functions"

// add new colors
$react: #00d8ff !default
$react-invert: findColorInvert($react) !default
$custom-colors: ("react": ($react, $react-invert))

// Import Bulma styles
@import "~bulma/bulma"

// Import rbx style fixes (**very simple**)
@import "~rbx/rbx"
```

### Update the `<Theme>`

If you've altered a [Bulma modifier](https://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/), you'll need to update the `<Theme>` at the root of your App, so that [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) uses the proper values for prop type-checking.

> **Note:** [_PropTypes_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) only provides literal type-checks on the global helpers – those located in `base/helpers`. I.e. _PropTypes_ will check that your new `"react"` color is in fact a `textColor`, but it will _not_ check that `"react"` is a valid `color` for `<Button>`, due to limitations on `PropTypes`.
> However, _TypeScript_ can perform this extended validation (as described in the next section).

```
// App.js

import { Generic, makeRootValidatingTransform, ThemeContext } from "rbx";

import { MyAppNavbar } from "./components";
import "./App.sass";

const COLORS = [ ...Generic.DEFAULTS.colors, "react" ] as const;

const themeValue = {
  transform: makeRootValidatingTransform({ colors: COLORS })
};

const App = () => (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={themeValue}>
    {/* supply your children components as you normally would */}
    <MyAppNavbar />
    <Button color="react">Hello world</Button>
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
);
```

If you're not modifying a _Bulma modifier_, but instead are extending a component's **\_DEFAULTS** (e.g. `BUTTON_DEFAULTS`), you don't need to explicitly set the `<Theme>`.

If you're not using _TypeScript_, then **you're done**. Otherwise...

### Updating the `TypeScript` types

To continue providing type-safety and prop auto-completion with this new configuration, you'll need to add an `rbx.d.ts` file to your project.
For adding a color (as demonstrated above), this file will look like:

```
// rbx.d.ts

import "rbx/base/helpers/variables";
import { VariablesDefaults } from "rbx/base/helpers/variables";

declare module "rbx/base/helpers/variables" {
  interface VariablesOverrides {
    colors: VariablesDefaults["colors"] | "react"; // we added `react`!
  }
}
```

If you instead modify a component's defaults, and not a _Bulma modifier_, simply use the template above, but with the appropriate `<COMPONENT>_DEFAULTS`.

Now, you'll continue to have auto-complete support, and type-safety while you develop.
