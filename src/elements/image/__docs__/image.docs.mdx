# Image

A container for **responsive images**.

The `<Image.Container>` is a precisely **sized container** so your layout isn't broken because images are loading or missing.

<Playground>
  <Image.Container size={128}>
    <Image src="https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/128x128.png" />
  </Image.Container>
</Playground>

### Fixed square images (i.e. dimmensional)

Use the `size` prop on `<Image.Container>` to contain it's underlying image to a fixed square size, useful for **avatars**.

_The `<Image.Container>` sizes that are **numbers** are dimmensions_

<Playground>
  <Table bordered>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>
          <code>Image.Container</code> size
        </th>
        <th>Result</th>
        <th>Dimmensions</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {IMAGE_CONTAINER_DEFAULTS.dimmensions.map((size, i) => (
        <tr key={i}>
          <td>
            <code>{size}</code>
          </td>
          <td>
            <Image.Container size={size}>
              <Image
                src={`https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/${size}x${size}.png`}
              />
            </Image.Container>
          </td>
          <td>{size}px sq.</td>
        </tr>
      ))}
    </tbody>
  </Table>
</Playground>

### Rounded images

Use the `rounded` prop on an `<Image>` to round it.

<Playground>
  <Image.Container size={128}>
    <Image rounded src="https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/128x128.png" />
  </Image.Container>
</Playground>

### Retina images

Because the `<Image.Container>` fixes the size of the underlying image, you can use a higher resolution image and contain it down to a smaller size.

For example, if you put an image with dimmensions `256x256` in an `<Image.Container>` with size `128` it'll be resized to `128x128`.

<Playground>
  <Image.Container size={128}>
    <Image src="https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/256x256.png" />
  </Image.Container>
</Playground>

### Responsive images (i.e. ratios)

Use the `size` prop on `<Image.Container>` to contain the underlying image to a known size ratio, useful when you dont' know the exact dimmensions.

_The `<Image.Container>` sizes that are **strings** are ratios (responsive sizes)_

Regardless of whether the child is an `img` or any other type of component, it will gain the `has-ratio` class automatically.
Therefore, `<Image.Container>` and `<Image>` can be used to size any type of underlying component using the `as` prop.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const sizeMap = [
      {size: "square", name: "480x480", description: "square (1 by 1)"},
      {size: "1by1", name: "480x480", description: "1 by 1"},

      {size: "16by9", name: "640x360", description: "16 by 9"},
      {size: "2by1", name: "640x320", description: "2 by 1"},
      {size: "3by1", name: "720x240", description: "3 by 1"},
      {size: "4by5", name: "480x600", description: "4 by 5"},

      {size: "1by3", name: "240x720", description: "1 by 3"},
    ];

    return (
      <Table bordered>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>
              <code>Image.Container</code> size
            </th>
            <th>Result</th>
            <th>Dimmensions</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {sizeMap.map(({ size, name, description }) => (
            <tr key={size}>
              <td>
                <code>{size}</code>
              </td>
              <td>
                <Image.Container size={size}>
                  <Image
                    src={`https://bulma.io/images/placeholders/${name}.png`}
                  />
                </Image.Container>
              </td>
              <td>{description}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </Table>
